# Build purely functional applications and libraries
Build stack-safe purely functional applications and libraries that support parallel and sequential computations where declaration is decoupled from interpretation.
Freestyle encourages programs built atop [Free algebras](./docs/core/algebras) that are interpreted at the edge of your application ensuring effects are localized and performed in a controlled environment.
Applications built with Freestyle can be interpreted to any runtime semantics supported by the interpreter target type.

# Automatic Dependency Injection
Freestyle includes all the implicit machinery necessary to achieve seamless dependency injection of [`@free`](./docs/core/algebras) and [`@module`](./docs/core/modules) Algebras.
Simply require any of your `@free` or `@module` trait as implicits where needed.

# Ready to use integrations
Freestyle ships with [ready to use algebras and convenient syntax extensions](./docs/integrations) covering most of the application concerns such as persistence, configuration, logging, etc.
In addition, Freestyle includes commonly used FP [effects](./docs/effects) stack such as `option`, `error`, `reader`, `writer`, `state` based on the capabilities of
the target runtime interpreters.
